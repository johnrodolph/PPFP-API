###PPFP-API



first you need to create a database in workbench mysql:

create database dbcostandemo

then make sure that in your workbench mysql username and password are the same in the application.properties


spring.datasource.username = root(edit if yours is different)
spring.datasource.password = root(edit if yours is different)

after doing this:
you right click the Application.java then choose Run java.

then you can go to the PPFP fron end.
